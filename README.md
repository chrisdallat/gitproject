## gitproject

Overview:

In this assignment, you will learn advanced concepts in Git version control system. You will be working with a small team to develop a Python project using Git. You will be practicing Git workflows, branching strategies, and conflict resolution techniques.

Instructions:

Form a team of 2 members:

    Chris Dallat
    Khalil Masree

Create a new Python project:

decided on a simple python project

    

Initialise a Git repository for the project:

    Once you have your project, you need to initialise a Git repository for version control. To do this, navigate to the project directory in your command line and enter the command git init.

Develop a feature branch strategy for the project:

    Decide on a branching strategy for your project. There are many different strategies you can use, such as Git flow or GitHub flow. You should discuss with your team and choose the best one for your project.

Implement at least three features in separate feature branches:

    Now that you have your branching strategy, create feature branches for each feature you plan to add to your project. Make changes to the code in the feature branches, committing changes frequently.

Merge the feature branches into a release branch:

    Once each feature is complete, merge the feature branches into a release branch. Test the release branch to ensure all features work together correctly.

Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge process:

    During the merge process, conflicts may arise if two or more team members have made changes to the same code. You need to resolve these conflicts before merging your branches. Follow the instructions in the resources provided above to resolve conflicts.

Implement at least one advanced Git workflow, such as Git rebase or Git cherry-pick, to manage the project history:

    Now that you have a release branch, use Git rebase or Git cherry-p

Submit your Git repository with a README file that explains your branching strategy and Git workflow implementation.

 

All students in the group should submit the assignment.
