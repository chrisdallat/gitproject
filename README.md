## gitproject

### Overview:

In this assignment, you will learn advanced concepts in Git version control system. You will be working with a small team to develop a Python project using Git. You will be practicing Git workflows, branching strategies, and conflict resolution techniques.

## Instructions:
### Form a team of 2 members:

    Chris Dallat
    Khalil Masree

### Create a new Python project

    We decided on a simple python project for a library system, with books and customers/patrons.

### Initialise a Git repository for the project:

    We initialised a git project on github.com/chrisdallat/gitproject

### Develop a feature branch strategy for the project:

    We decided to make branches based on each class that we implemented, so we had a branch for Book, Patron and Library.
    
    First we cloned onto both our computers so we were working on the same project. Then
    we added basic file main.py and added a main() and pushed it to the main/master branch. Then we added a branch of book without pulling the main we commited the changed that we created for class Book and then we did git pull and git rebase main and resolved relevant conflicts and then created a pull request which the other could review and merge.

    Khalil then built the Patron class with multiple commits to a Patron branch. and created a pull request, I was then able to do Squash & Merge to combine all the commits into one commit before merging. 

    We then made the final library class on Library branch and then tested the running code combined. and fixed whatever final errors we had in the main and added a couple more methods in Library and merged finally everything to main branch as production code.
